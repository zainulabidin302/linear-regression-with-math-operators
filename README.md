# Linear regression with math operators

The data set is a random uniform sample generated with numpy. The seed for random generator is set fixed to produce identical results. Changing the random state does not effect the result too much. Sample size is 10,000 which captures the pattern fairly and increasing the dataset size has not a big impact on result. It is a multiple regression example because there are two operands. For addition and Subtraction, the regression is producing best results. For other three operations (multiplication, division and exponent) the regression is performing worse.


## Addition

## Subtraction

## Multiplication

## Division

## Exponent (Power)
