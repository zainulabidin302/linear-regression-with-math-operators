# Linear regression with math operators

The data set is a random uniform sample generated with numpy. The random state is set fixed. Chaning the random state does not effect the result too much. Sample size size is 10,000. It's a multiple regression example because for every output there are two operands. For addition and Subtraction, the results are perfect. For other three operations (multiplication, division and exponent) the regression is performing worse.


## Addition

## Subtraction

## Multiplication

## Division

## Exponent (Power)
